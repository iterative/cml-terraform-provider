# Terraform Iterative provider

The Iterative Provider is a Terraform plugin that enables full lifecycle
management of cloud computing resources, including GPUs, from your favorite
[vendors](#supported-vendors). Two types of resources are available:

- Runner (`iterative_cml_runner`)
- Machine (`iterative_machine`)

The Provider is designed for benefits like:

- Unified logging for workflows run in cloud resources
- Automatic provision of cloud resources
- Automatic unregister and removal of cloud resources (never forget to turn your
  GPU off again)
- Arguments inherited from the GitHub/GitLab runner for ease of integration
  (`name`,`labels`,`idle-timeout`,`repo`,`token`, and `driver`)

## Usage

### Runner

A self hosted runner based on a thin wrapper over the GitLab and GitHub
self-hosted [runners](https://github.com/actions/runner), abstracting their
functionality to a common specification that allows adjusting the main runner
settings, like idle timeouts, or custom runner labels.

The runner resource also provides features like unified logging and automated
cloud resource provisioning and management through various vendors.

#### Configuring the vendor credentials

This provider requires a repository token for registering and unregistering
self-hosted runners during the cloud resource lifecycle. Depending on the
platform you use, the instructions to get that token may vary; please refer to
your platform documentation:

- [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/es/github-ae@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
- [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html)

This token can be passed to the provider through the `CML_TOKEN` or environment
variable, like in the following example:

```sh
export CML_TOKEN=···
```

Additionally, you need to provide credentials for the cloud provider where the
computing resources should be allocated. Follow the steps below to get started.

#### Basic usage

1. - Setup your provider credentials as ENV variables

<details>
<summary>AWS</summary>
<p>

```sh
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_KEY
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ID
export CML_TOKEN=YOUR_REPO_TOKEN
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Azure</summary>
<p>

```sh
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_ID
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=YOUR_TENANT_ID
export CML_TOKEN=YOUR_REPO_TOKEN
```

</p>
</details>

2. Save your terraform file `main.tf`.

<details>
<summary>AWS</summary>
<p>

```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    iterative = {
      source = "iterative/iterative"
    }
  }
}

provider "iterative" {}

resource "iterative_machine" "machine" {
    repo = "https://github.com/iterative/cml"
    driver = "github"
    labels = "tf"

    cloud = "aws"
    region = "us-west"
    instance_type = "m"
    # Uncomment it if GPU is needed:
    # instance_gpu = "tesla"
}
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Azure</summary>
<p>

```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    iterative = {
      source = "iterative/iterative"
    }
  }
}

provider "iterative" {}

resource "iterative_machine" "machine" {
   repo = "https://github.com/iterative/cml"
    driver = "github"
    labels = "tf"

    cloud = "azure"
    region = "us-west"
    instance_type = "m"
    # Uncomment it if GPU is needed:
    # instance_gpu = "tesla"
}
```

</p>
</details>

3. Launch it!

```sh
terraform init
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

## Requirements

To be able to use `instance_type` and `instance_gpu`, you'll need access to
launch [instances from supported cloud vendors](#Supported-vendors). Please
ensure that you have sufficient quotas with your cloud provider for the
instances you intend to provision with Iterative Provider. If you're just
starting out with a new account with a vendor, we recommend trying Iterative
Provider with approved instances, such as the `t2.micro` instance for AWS.

<summary>Example with native AWS instace type and region</summary>
<p>

```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    iterative = {
      source = "iterative/iterative"
      version = "0.5.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "iterative" {}

resource "iterative_machine" "machine" {
  region = "us-west-1"
  ami = "iterative-cml"
  instance_name = "machine"
  instance_hdd_size = "10"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

</p>
</details>

## Supported vendors

The Iterative Provider currently supports AWS and Azure. Google Cloud Platform
is not currently supported.

The instance type in AWS is calculated by joining the `instance_type` and
`instance_gpu` values.
