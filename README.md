# Terraform Provider Iterative

The Terraform Iterative provider is a plugin for Terraform that allows for the
full lifecycle management of GPU or non GPU cloud resources with your favourite
[vendor](#supported-vendors). The provider offers a simple and homogeneous way
to deploy a GPU or a cluster of them reducing the complexity.

# Usage

```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    iterative = {
      source = "iterative/iterative"
      version = "0.5.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "iterative" {}

resource "iterative_machine" "machine" {
  region = "us-west"
  instance_name = "machine"
  instance_hdd_size = "20"
  instance_type = "m"
  instance_gpu = "tesla"
}
```

| `region`            | `us-west` `us-east` `eu-west` `eu-north` | `us-west`       | Sets the collocation region                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

For that the provider does a search in the cloud provider by image name not by id, taking the lastest version in case there are many with the same name. Defaults to [iterative-cml image](#iterative-cml-image) |
| `instance_name`     |                                          | cml\_{UID}      | Sets the instance name and related resources like AWS key pair.                                                                                                                                                                           |

You can also specify vendor specific machines in AWS i.e. `t2.micro`                                                                                                                                   |

If specified the instance will be launched in with that sg within the vpc managed by the specified sg. If not a new sg called `cml` will be created under the default vpc      |

### AWS instance equivalences.

The instance type in AWS is calculated joining the `instance_type` and
`instance_gpu`

| type | gpu   | aws         |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| m    |       | m5.2xlarge  |
| l    |       | m5.8xlarge  |
| xl   |       | m5.16xlarge |
| m    | k80   | p2.xlarge   |
| l    | k80   | p2.8xlarge  |
| xl   | k80   | p2.16xlarge |
| m    | tesla | p3.xlarge   |
| l    | tesla | p3.8xlarge  |
| xl   | tesla | p3.16xlarge |

| region   | aws        |
